I am a third year student, studying computer engineering.
One day when I was pretty bored becauce I didn't have internet, I decided to 
create a module in python (because i think i have better understanding of it as a PL as of others)
named MatrixShell designed to store matrices and do basic operations on them
like find the determinant and multiply etc etc.

This project is designed to meerely be a glimpse that I want to take in the programming world,
and help me understand how GitHub works, while I continue to perfect my skills in Python.

01-Oct-20 Update
Added cramers and random_i to MatrixShell: the first function solves linear systems of equations 
given the MatrixShell A and the vector [x1, x2, x3,...], the second function creates randomized 
squared MatrixShells with integer elements from a given range.
Added 2 new files that analyse certain aspects like determinant frequency and solving time using 
cramers and the inverse of a MatrixShell

22-Oct-20 Update
I will call this matrix project officially closed, if anyone would be interested to continue it 
here are some ideas as of what to do next:
1. define a new function that does a gauss-jordan elemination and returns a MatrixShell object
2. convert all of the code or parts of it (determinant) into julia language code so it is faster
