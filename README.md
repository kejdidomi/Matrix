I am a third year student, studying computer engineering.
One day when I was pretty bored becauce I didn't have internet, I decided to 
create a module in python (because i think i have better understanding of it as a PL as of others)
named MatrixShell designed to store matrices and do basic operations on them
like find the determinant and multiply etc etc.

This project is designed to meerely be a glimpse that I want to take in the programming world,
and help me understand how GitHub works, while I continue to perfect my skills in Python.
